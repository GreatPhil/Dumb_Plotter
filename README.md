# Dumb_Plotter
This script generates a scatter-plot of car prices and mileage.
Instead of using the fancy plotting abilities of numpy or matplotlib, I wanted to see if I could create a simple text-based plotting tool, and use it to find some good deals on Porsche 911's currently for sale on Craigslist in the SFBay area (8-10-2017)
