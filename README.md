# Dumb_Plotter
- This script generates a scatter-plot of car prices and mileage.
- Instead of using the fancy plotting abilities of numpy or matplotlib, I wanted to see if I could create a simple, quick-n-dirty, text-based plotting tool -- and use it to find some good deals on Porsche 911's currently for sale on Craigslist in the SFBay area (as of 8/10/2017).  This tool could be used for scatter plotting any binominal data set, really.
